# liberLibri

## Link to frontend
[LiberLibriApp](https://github.com/melvin-codes/liberLibriApp)

## What I Used
1) The IDE's I used were IntelliJ and Visual Studio Code thus the cors filter

2) MySQL for the database. Use it too for simplicity sake. Unless you want to change the pom.xml file then be my quest.

3) Angular/CLI because I'm learning it as well as Spring Boot 2.7.X

## How to Run
1) First thing you want to do is create your database. I used MySQL so that would be easiest. I also used their command line client as using workbench wouldn't work.
  Once that is done you then have to change your username and password from the application.properties located in the resources folder.
  
2) Also make sure you changed your port numbers if you are not using the default port of "3306". Same goes for the "LiberLibriApplication" with the cors filter if you
  changed your angular port number as well. This makes it possible as you will be using two seperate IDE's.

3) After you've done all that you're pretty much ready to run the backend of liber libri.
